                <p>
                    Park Gunwook was born with other worldly visuals. 
                    <b>But what is his most attractive point?</b>
                    That is what we will attempt to tackle today.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With rosy cheeks, a sharp jawline, and a gummy smile, many are charmed by his face.
                    But what if I told you his <em>true</em> charm lies in his physique?
                </p>
                <p>
                    You would probably instantly agree. It's difficult to fight the facts.
                    With wide shoulders, long legs, and a crazy wingspan, his physique is to die for.
                </p>
                <p>This is exactly what makes him one of this generations <strong>BEST</strong> K-pop dancers.</p>

            <div class="topic">
                <h2 id="dancing">2. Dancing</h2>
                <p>
                    With his insane physique, it is as though he was born to perform powerful dances.
                    This fact was established during his 
                    <a href="https://youtu.be/C6_jQyNJyiM?si=dbPlNaUFshevInxO" target="_blank">audition</a> 
                    for the show <i>Boys Planet</i>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    But he seems to have even further grown in dancing ability.
                    You can watch any Gunwook fancam and see he is an impressive dancer.
                    But I will leave a video here for your convenience.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Unfortunately I was unable to get the video with audio, 
                    but I suppose it is a blessing in disguise as you can fully immerse yourself in his dancing.
                </p>
                <p><strong>BUT FEAR NOT!</strong> The next two topics of discussion will be audio-ful and delightful.</p>

                <h2 id="rapping">3. Rapping</h2>
                <p>
                    Park Gunwook is undoubtedly a talented rapper. 
                    He has been personally acknowledged by many artists in the K-HipHop scene.
                </p>
                <audio src="./assets/gunwook-rap.mp3" controls>Park Gunwook - Backpacker (K-drama OST)</audio>
                <p>
                    This is a song he wrote with his bandmate Seok Matthew, used as a K-drama OST.
                    It went triple platinum in my bedroom (slang for "its very good").

                <h2 id="singing">4. Singing</h2>
                <p>
                    Not only is he a talented lyricist, but he is also an amazing singer!
                    Despite it not being his main position, he is given many parts due to his ability.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In particular, I've enjoyed his parts in one of the groups more recent songs, "Step Back".
